//! # zxc-money
//!
//! A pure-Rust personal finance core library built with Domain-Driven Design.
//!
//! This crate provides the domain model and application layer for personal finance
//! management. It is designed as a **modular monolith** consumed by any frontend
//! (TUI, web, mobile) via well-defined ports/traits. The core knows nothing about
//! HTTP, terminals, or UI frameworks.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Each bounded context follows DDD layered architecture:
//!
//! ```text
//! module/
//! ├── domain/
//! │   ├── {aggregate}.rs     → Aggregate root / entity
//! │   ├── events.rs          → Domain events
//! │   └── repository.rs      → Repository traits (ports)
//! └── application/
//!     └── {use_case}.rs       → Command handler (one per operation)
//! ```
//!
//! Cross-module communication happens exclusively through domain events.
//! Modules never access each other's repositories directly.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`shared`] — Value objects, error types, event system, ID types, mocks
//! - [`provider`] — Port traits for ID generation, datetime, and statement parsing
//! - [`ledger`] — Accounts, transactions, transfers, recurring transactions
//! - [`credit_card`] — Credit cards, invoices, purchases, installments
//! - [`bills`] — Bills reminder (scheduled payments)
//! - [`budgeting`] — Budgets by category, financial goals
//! - [`investment`] — Portfolios, assets, positions
//! - [`importing`] — Statement parsing, preview, and import pipeline
//! - [`planning`] — Loan, mortgage, retirement, net salary simulators
//! - [`reporting`] — Account balance projections, net worth (read side)
